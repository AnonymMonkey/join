        <p class="text">Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban 
          project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what Join is, 
          how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
        </p>
        <h1 class="headlineMid">What is Join?</h1>
        <p class="text">
          Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group 
          of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the 
          Developer Akademie. Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly 
          effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency 
          (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their 
          tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
          It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is 
          not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible 
          user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, 
          or other aspects of quality regarding Join.

        <h1 class="headlineMid">How to use it</h1>
        <p class="text">Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</p>
        
        <div class="counts">
          <div>1.</div>
          <div><b>Exploring the Board</b><br>
            When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents your 
            project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” 
            and "Done".
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="counts">
          <div>2.</div>
          <div><b>Creating Contacts</b><br>
            In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" 
            section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, 
            these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the 
            board.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="counts">
          <div>3.</div>
          <div><b>Adding Cards</b><br>
            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent 
            individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new 
            card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, 
            assignees, etc.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="counts">
          <div>4.</div>
          <div><b>Moving Cards</b><br>
            Moving Cards As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that 
            on the board by dragging and dropping the card from 
            one list to another.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="counts">
          <div>5.</div>
          <div><b>Deleting Cards</b><br>
            Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
            Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution
            when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible. <br>
            <br>
            Remember that using Join effectively requieres consistent updates from you and your
            team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.<br>
